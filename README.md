A few tasks I worked through in the Python section of my Data Skills Bootcamp

A Little Game
The task was to enter two numbers, the program would then tell you which was higher.

20 Questions (if you're bad at guessing!)
This program generates a random number between 10 and 100. You then try to guess the number, the program will tell you if you're too high or too low.

Eventually you should get it right

Python using Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn Libraries

A csv file with two columns (income & happiness) was loaded into Google Colab.

I then imported the matplotlib and seaborn libraries and generated two scatter charts, one using matplotlib and seaborn and the other using pandas.

Adding a trend line
Adding a trend line reinforced the positive correlation between income and happiness.

And they say you can't buy happiness!
